# R/RStudio Overview

## What is `R`?

"R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis...as of September 2020, R ranks 9th in the TIOBE index, a measure of popularity of programming languages. A GNU package, the official R software environment is written primarily in C, Fortran, and R itself...and is freely available under the GNU General Public License...Although R has a command line interface, there are several third-party graphical user interfaces, such as RStudio, an integrated development environment, and Jupyter, a notebook interface" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language))).

R is based on the S programming language, which is based on/inspired by programming language Scheme.

The S programming language was developed by Bell Labs in the late 1970s.

University of Auckland researchers Ross Ihaka nad Robert Gentleman developed an alternative implementation of S in the early 1990s that by 1995 was the first open-source release of R (under a GNU license).

R is supported and maintained by the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), which formed in 1997. 

CRAN released the first stable, beta version of R (1.0) in 2000.

## What is `RStudio`?

"RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R, a programming language for statistical computing and graphics" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RStudio)).

What is an IDE? "An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)).

An IDE can include features like syntax highlighting, code completion, version control, and debugging.

There are a WIDE range of IDEs that are proprietary or open-source, tailored to a specific language or able to work across languages.

Some common IDEs include Eclipse, Geany, Brackets, Atom, PyCharm, Spyder, RStudio, etc. For more on IDEs, visit Wikipedia's ["Comparison of integrated development environments"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_integrated_development_environments) page.

RStudio is written in C++ and Java, with some JavaScript. It uses the Qt framework for its graphical user interface.

The first public version of RStudio (v0.92) was released in 2011. Version 1.0 was released in 2016.

The RStudio IDE is supported and maintained by a team of developers collectively known as RStudio.

# Getting Started With RStudio

## Accessing RStudio

For this class, you can access RStudio two ways, through downloading and installing on your local computer or through running RStudio in a web browser using RStudio Cloud.

To run R on your personal computer:
- Download and install `R` from http://www.r-project.org/
- Download and install `RStudio` from http://www.rstudio.com/

To use RStudio Cloud:
- Navigate to https://rstudio.cloud/ in a web browser
- Create a free account


## RStudio's Layout

When you open RStudio (on a personal computer or via RStudio Cloud) for the first time, you will see three default windows or panels.

The ***Console*** (left side of the window) is similar to the command line or terminal. It can run program files or execute commands typed directly into the console.

Your ***Environment*** (top right) shows you the names of datasets, variables, and user-created functions that have been loaded into your workspace and can be accessed by your code.

The ***Files/Plots/Help Viewer*** (bottom right) will display graphics generated by your code (Plots), Files that are part of your project (Files), or additional documentation or support (Help).

This default layout gives us the option to execute commands using the console, but we don't actually have a blank program file we can use to write, test, and save programs.

We can create a new RScript file by clicking `File -> New File -> RScript`.

We now see the blank `.R` file as a fourth panel in the top-left hand side of our window.

Save the blank file and you should see the new .R file show up in your `Files` panel.

Question #1: Create a blank R Script and save it as “Lab1_[LastName]”, where [LastName] is r eplaced by your last name. Use this R Script to record your answers to this lab’s questions. You can also use this script to try out all of the example code shown throughout the lab, but the lab notebook only needs to include answers to the question prompts.

# Using R

`R` is an interpreted language, which allows you to have the computer execute any piece of the code in your RScript at any time.

To run a piece of code, simply highlight it and hit Ctrl-Enter. You should see the code that you ran appear in the Console, along with the response generated by the code.

You can also move your cursor to a specific line and run that section of code.

## R as a Calculator

At its most basic level, `R` can be used to perform arithmetic operations.

Try running these examples in the Console or using your new R Script.

```R
4 + 6 - (24/6)
```

```R
5 ^ 2 + 2 * 2
```

Some arithmetic operations require the use of functions. 

In the example below, the function “exp” raises the number e to the power you provide as an input to the function. 

The number “2” is given as an input into the function `exp`:
```R
exp(2)
```

The `sqrt` function finds a square root:
```R
sqrt(4)
```

The `abs` function takes the absolute value:
```R
abs(-1)
```

A function’s *inputs* are called *arguments* in `R` documentation. 

For complex functions, the arguments should be specified using names which are internally defined within the function. 

The example below takes the base two logarithm of the number 4 using the `log` function and appropriate inputs to the arguments `x` and `base`.

```R
log(x = 4, base = 2)
```

## Help Documentation

`R` contains thousands of functions, each potentially containing many different arguments. 

When using an unfamiliar function for the first time, it can be useful to refer to that function’s documentation.

The documentation which will describe the function’s uses and arguments. 

You can pull up a function’s documentation by typing `?` before the function’s name in the console. 
For example, if we wanted to see the documentation for the `log` function:
```R
?log
```

## Including Comments

When coding, it is good practice to include comments that describe what your code is doing. 

In `R` the `#` character is used to start a comment. 

Everything on the same line to the right of the `#` will not be executed when that line is submitted to the console.

```R
# This entire line is a comment and will not be executed as part of the program
```

```R
1:6 # The command "1:6" appears before this comment
```

In your RScript, comments appear in green. 

Remember that the `#`” starts a comment only for a single line of your RScript, so long comments that requiring multiple lines should each begin with their own `#`.

Question #2: In the R Script created for Question #1, add a comment with the text “Question 2” on your script’s first line. Then, in the second line, write code that finds the square root of the absolute value of negative four.

# Objects and Assignments

`R` stores data in containers called ***objects***. 

Data is ***assigned*** to an object using `<=` or `=`.

After assignment, data can be referenced using the object name.

This is similar to how a programming language like Python interacts with named variables.

The simplest objects are called ***scalars***, or a single ***element***.

```R
x <- 5 # Assigns the integer value to an object labeled x

x^2 # Performs an arithemtic operation using the value assigned to x
```

`R` stores sequences of elements in objects called ***vectors***.

```R
x <- 1:3 # the sequence (1, 2, 3) is assigned to the vector named x
print(x) # prints the sequence assigned to x vector
```

```R
y <- c(1, 2, 3) # the function 'c' concatenates arguments separated by commas into a vector
print(y)
```

```R
z <- c("A","B","C") # vectors can contain many different kinds of characters- not just numbers
print(z)
```

There are three different types of vectors in `R`:
- Numeric vectors: `x = c(1, 2, 3)`
- Character vectors: `x = c("A","B","C")`
- Logical vectors: `x = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)`

A vector's type is important, because many functions will only execute on a certain type of input.

A function will return an error message is given an input of the wrong type.

We can check an object type using the `typeof` function.

```R
chars <- c("1","2","3") # creates a character vector
typeof(chars)
```

```R
nums <- c(1,2,3) # creates a numeric vector
typeof(nums)
```

```R
mean(chars) # this command will produce an error, because mean() only works for numeric vectors
```

```R
mean(nums) # this will work because nums is a numeric vector
```
