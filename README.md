## Lab Goals

This lab provides a very brief introduction to `RStudio`, its user interface, some basic `R` programming, and a publishing extension known as `RMarkdown`.

## Acknowledgements

This lab procedure is adapted from and based on Ryan Miller's ["A Crash Course in R" tutorial](https://remiller1450.github.io/s230f19/Intro_to_R.html) (Fall 2019, Intro to Data Science STA 230 course, Grinnell College).

# R/RStudio Overview

## What is `R`?

"R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis...as of September 2020, R ranks 9th in the TIOBE index, a measure of popularity of programming languages. A GNU package, the official R software environment is written primarily in C, Fortran, and R itself...and is freely available under the GNU General Public License...Although R has a command line interface, there are several third-party graphical user interfaces, such as RStudio, an integrated development environment, and Jupyter, a notebook interface" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language))).

R is based on the S programming language, which is based on/inspired by programming language Scheme.

The S programming language was developed by Bell Labs in the late 1970s.

University of Auckland researchers Ross Ihaka nad Robert Gentleman developed an alternative implementation of S in the early 1990s that by 1995 was the first open-source release of R (under a GNU license).

R is supported and maintained by the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), which formed in 1997. 

CRAN released the first stable, beta version of R (1.0) in 2000.
